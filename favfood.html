        <h2>My Favorite Foods ðŸ¥™ (yum!)</h2>
        <p>It's hard to choose, but here are some of my favorite foods from around the world (in no particular order):</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
              <div class="food-item">
                <img src="images/foods/shawarma.jpg" alt="Shawarma">
                <div class="food-text">
                  <h3>Shawarma with Spicy Garlic Sauce</h3>
                  <p>Tender marinated meat, flavorful spices, additional veggies and a creamy garlic sauce all wrapped in a warm pita bread. Truly an irresistible Middle Eastern food! (Homemade or not, heavenly taste).</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="food-item">
                <img src="images/foods/spring_rolls.jpg" alt="Spring Rolls">
                <div class="food-text">
                  <h3>Spring Rolls</h3>
                  <p>Crispy on the outside, filled with fresh and savory ingredients. A perfect appetizer or light meal. Usually prefer Vietnamese Style.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="food-item">
                <img src="images/foods/butter_chicken.webp" alt="Butter Chicken">
                <div class="food-text">
                  <h3>Butter Chicken with Naan and Chutney</h3>
                  <p>A classic Indian dish with (preferably mild) creamy tomato-based sauce, tender chicken, and fluffy naan bread. In my opinion, the perfect fullfilling and comfort food.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="food-item">
                <img src="images/foods/tacos.jpg" alt="Tacos">
                <div class="food-text">
                  <h3>All Kinds of Tacos and Burritos</h3>
                  <p>From classic street tacos to loaded burritos, the variety and flavors of Mexican food are endless. Mexicans truly know what they're doing. Nothing beats a street food taco. What explains the attractiveness is the similarities to Middle Eastern food, which hits close to home.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="food-item">
                <img src="images/foods/shakshuka.jpg" alt="Shakshuka">
                <div class="food-text">
                  <h3>Shakshuka</h3>
                  <p>Eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce with peppers and onions. A very hearty and flavorful breakfast or brunch option. One of many traditional dishes of Tunisia (my origin country) that became the standard of breakfasts across the North African/Middle East region and other.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="food-item">
                <img src="images/foods/fried_chicken.jpg" alt="Fried Chicken">
                <div class="food-text">
                  <h3>Fried Chicken and Salad</h3>
                  <p>Crispy, juicy fried chicken paired with a fresh and vibrant salad for a satisfying and balanced meal.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="food-item">
                <img src="images/foods/mediterranean_breakfast.webp" alt="Mediterranean Breakfast">
                <div class="food-text">
                  <h3>Mediterranean-Style Breakfasts</h3>
                  <p>Fresh vegetables, olives, cheeses, proteins (usually eggs) and warm pita bread. A healthy, nutritional and delicious way to start the day.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="food-item">
                <img src="images/foods/falafel.jpg" alt="Falafel">
                <div class="food-text">
                  <h3>Falafel</h3>
                  <p>Crispy fried chickpea patties, perfect in a pita with hummus and tahini sauce. A flavorful and satisfying vegetarian option, which I am always excited to have. Also hits home!</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="food-item">
                <img src="images/foods/mloukhia.png" alt="Mloukhia">
                <div class="food-text">
                  <h3>Mloukhia</h3>
                  <p>A unique and flavorful stew made with jute leaves, often served with rice or bread. A true taste of North African cuisine (also country of origin), don't let the unfamiliar look fool you.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="food-item">
                <img src="images/foods/pasta.jpg" alt="Pasta">
                <div class="food-text">
                  <h3>Pasta</h3>
                  <p>From simple spaghetti to creamy dishes, pasta is a versatile yet delicious and easy to make comfort food.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </li>
          </ol>

        <p>These are just a few of my favorites (that I can recall), but I'm always trying new foods (and yet have to see which will take the top spots)!</p>
